# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I decided to go back to the fundamentals of The Odin Project curriculum as I coasted through it the first time. Today I finished Fundamentals Part 1

**Thoughts:** I basically did a revision of declaring a variable, types of operators, operator precedence. I forgot about unary operators, but I got a refresher of it as well as converting strings to numbers. Let me not forget that doing arithmetic between a string and a number results in NaN(except '+' which concatenates). Lastly variables, declared with var, are either function-scoped or global-scoped and var tolerates redeclarations.

### Day 1: January 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I didn't have all the time to write some code due to a city wide blackout. I still managed to do some exercises on strings and string methods in JavasScript. Some of the exercises were over here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Test_your_skills:_Strings. This is still part of TOP curriculum, Fundamentals Part 2

**Thoughts:** It was all basic and I was capable of dong these exercises thoroughly.

### Day 2: January 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I did the bare minimum of coding and just about finished with understanding string methods and manipulation on the foundation part of TOP

**Thoughts:** Doing the exercises for the first time since returning to this section isn't so bad. It was simple.

### Day 3: January 27, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued working on the TOP curriculum, doing conditionals. Did some of the exercises on MDN

**Thoughts:** I realized I didn't know that pressing ESC during a prompt returns null and it reminded me of why I had errors when I tried to code my rock paper scissors project a month or so ago.

### Day 4: January 28, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today was especially slow. I only managed to code an hour and a half before midnight but I'm glad I did. Still worked on some conditional exercises.

**Thoughts:** For the most part I understand using if...else and switch. I managed to use the teneray operator but I kept going back to see if I got the syntax correct. I made some errors as well when assigning string variables

### Day 5: January 30, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Probably did like 30 minutes of work and code. It's better than not doing anything.

**Thoughts:** There was power so I couldn't do much

### Day 6: January 31, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started fundamentals Part 3 of TOP, functions and got a better understanding of using JavaScript developer tools

**Thoughts:** I have a clearer understanding of debugging by using breakpoints

### Day 7: February 1, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Practice more function exercises as well as having a clear understanding of arrow functions.

**Thoughts:** The arrow function syntax makes sense. Understanding how to go about dealing with errors was fairly simple too

### Day 8: February 2, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I took another step at the rock, paper, scissors project. Everything went relatively quick until my logic failed return the results.

**Thoughts:** I need to break down the logic further to simpler steps, and deal with the error of empty string and null

### Day 9: February 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I managed to nail down the logic for playing a single round of the game, however, I still couldn't find a solution to the error I received due to null not having a .toLowerCase() property.

**Thoughts:** I dwelled on quite a while trying to fix the error that is returned when prompt is cancelled even though the entirety of the logic still works.

### Day 10: February 4, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I barely had time to practice and work on completing my project due to situations that were beyond my control. I somehow managed to write a logic for the final part that I need to make work.

**Thoughts:** Not much, didn't have that much time

### Day 11: February 5, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I didn't do as much as I would have liked and took a lot of time trying to work out a logic for running a 5 round game of rock paper scissors

**Thoughts:** I got it to work somehow but not completely to what I need it to be

### Day 12: February 6, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I completed the first part of the rock paper scissors project of TOP. I will revisit it after a few lessons. I also did some reading on writing clean code through TOP's curriculum

**Thoughts:** I still have a long way to go when solving problems for a project. Nevertheless, I'll keep grinding.

### Day 13: February 7, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued on the TOP curriculum and read upon loops and arrays and also did a few exercises from the resources provided by TOP

**Thoughts:** I may have rushed through the Labels for break/continue on javascript.info and have to revisit it in the future, but I understand the loop types and how arrays work

### Day 14: February 8, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I read on TDD (test driven development) and managed just a couple of exercises

**Thoughts:** TDD of top were slightly tricky, but manageable.
